🙋‍♀ **_Hey, I'm JungAh!_** 

_Pleased to meet you._

:star: I'm deeply invested in learning Full-stack development. I also do as much as possible in the open and try to support my open source communities. I am passionate about human-computer interaction so, on my personal time, I  write a lot on a wide range of topics regarding full-stack development.

You can check all my project on my website.

:sparkler: I like making things, I'm a fairly curious person. I also love to travel, especially to Python and Django conferences!

:christmas_tree:Thanks for visiting!
